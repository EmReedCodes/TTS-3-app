# Practice and Repeat Speech

 <p>
    I made a website where you can create a bank of words you would like to practice saying outloud and a text to speech function that will repeat those words in a text to speech function. My son was my inspiration as he is diagnosed with a speech delay and would often ask me how to correctly say a word. Now he has his own application to practice whenever he wants. </p>

## Description

To use this website you can just input any words you'd like to practice into the word bank and it will display up to 10 words on the page and the rest will be stored in the database. Using the next button will bring back one of your words at random and you can repeat that word as often as you like until you are ready for the next. With the slider range you can speed up or slow a word down as you practice and improve.
